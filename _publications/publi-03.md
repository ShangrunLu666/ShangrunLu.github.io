The invention discloses a magnetic suspension charging type sound box which comprises a base, wherein a circular groove is formed in the upper end of the base, a device groove is formed in the inner bottom of the circular groove, two damping devices are fixedly connected to the inner bottom of the device groove, a magnetic suspension mechanism is jointly installed at the upper ends of the two damping devices, and a metal elastic sheet is installed at the lower end of the magnetic suspension mechanism. According to the invention, the rotating wheel is rotated to drive the worm to rotate, the worm rotates to drive the worm wheel to rotate, the worm wheel rotates to drive the cylinder fixedly connected with the worm wheel to rotate, the cylinder rotates to drive the threaded rod in threaded connection with the cylinder to move, the threaded rod moves to push the clamping block to fix the magnetic suspension mechanism, and the metal elastic sheet at the lower end of the magnetic suspension mechanism is contacted with the power supply, when the electric wire is connected with an external power supply, the magnetic suspension mechanism is electrified to generate magnetic force, so that the sound equipment is suspended; the spring can take place deformation under the effect of magnetic suspension mechanism gravity, and then makes the impact to the power supply ware when reducing magnetic suspension mechanism and moving downwards.
